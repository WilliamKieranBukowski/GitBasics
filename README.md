# GitBasics

This is a notepad file with some basics on how to utilize Git and by assocation Github.com to both
securely store your code online where it can always be accessed as well as establish good version 
control over your software in order to better build and maintain it.

Please use the txt file any way you like, it would be nice to see someone use this other than me.
